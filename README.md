# Pectin Synthesis Gene Families Research

Alignment code: 
- Used to identify amino acid residues that could contribute to differences in these proteins within grasses, non-grass commelinids, non-commelinid monocots, and dicots. 

Remove Short Genes:
- Removes genes that are short/potentially incorrectly sequenced by removing genes that have an alignment length that is less than some percentage of the query sequence length.
