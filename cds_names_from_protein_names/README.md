# How to use this code: 

This code takes two arguments: 
- `-i`: The input file containing a list of protein gene names
- `-o`: The ouput file, which will contain the cds gene names. If none is given, the output will print to the screen. 

### Example: 
`python fix_cds_names.py -i identifying_genes/RRT_protein_genes.txt -o RRT_cds_genes.txt`
